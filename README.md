# prophet-challenge
Challenge 8

This challenge was part of our introduction to Google Colab. As someone new to coding, machine learning, and AI, I found the instruction on Google Colab very fascinating!  I really enjoyed this block of instruction as well. This challenge tasked me with analyzing the company's, Mercado Libre, financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow.  

Process steps: (1)  I had to find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic, (2) Mine the search traffic data for seasonality, (3) Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns, and (4) Create a time series model with Prophet.
