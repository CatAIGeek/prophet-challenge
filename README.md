Challenge 8
This challenge was part of our introduction to Google Colab. As someone new to coding, machine learning, and AI, I found the instruction on Google Colab very fascinating!  I really enjoyed this block of instruction as well. 
Although I don't have a technical background at all, I feel that this was the first time during the course that things began to "click" - if that makes sense.  And although this was still a challenge for me, having access to tutors has helped my understand greatly and they also showed me additional tools to help guide a newbie like me (mostly websites and videos that help explain things a little better). 
It still takes me a really long time to figure out the code to write, but I am getting better I think.
For the code used in this challenge, I used a plethra of resources. I did lean heavily on the classroom activities that the instructor taught and they were very useful!  
Additionally, I asked questions of both tutors and AskBCS Learning Assitants, which proved very useful in explaining things when I got stuck and provided assistance in helping me figure out the right code.
I still have a long way to go and A LOT to learn, but this was actually a fun challenge! Because it still takes me so long to code, I ran out of time before completing the assignment, but I will continue to work on it to finishe it through.
